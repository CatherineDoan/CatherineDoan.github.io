<p>JN: Why am I here again?<br/>
    MC: Relax. This is the last time We need to question you.<br/>
    MC: We found an envelope with approximately a million won in cash in your bluetooth speaker case, addressed to you. Is there anything you’d like to share?<br/>
    JN: *freezing up* Y-you what?<br/>
