<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div class="Phone">
    WELCOME TO THE DAPA FILES! Before we start the game, let me introduce the game for you.<br/>
    <br/>
    This game is played by interrogating the five suspects and reviewing evidence released every in-game day.<br/>
    In this game, a day will end once you've had three interrogations with any of the suspects.
    <br/>
    You can interrogate the suspects by clicking on the '> Interrogate him' text at the end of each suspects'
    profile, and you can review evidence by clicking on the '> Review' button after the suspect profiles.<br/>
    <br/>
    Along the way, you will periodically receive clues in the form of texts from your investigator boss. It would be wise to
    listen to them. As for the evidence, remember to check them to reveal crucial hints!<br/>
    <br/>
    At the end of the game, you will be asked to accuse one of the five suspects. After that, the real story will be revealed
    to you.<br/>
    <br/>
    So with that out of the way, welcome to the DAPA files, detective! Private investigator Moon Taeil has just sent you the
    briefing. Good luck!<br/>
