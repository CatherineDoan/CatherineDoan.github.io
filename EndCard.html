<h1>A Mysterious Text</h1>
<div class="Phone">
    Hello Detective. I got your number from Taeil.<br/>
    <br/>
    How are you? Actually, scratch that, you can’t text back to a burner phone.<br/>
    <br/>
    I’m writing this after our last conversation, scheduled to be sent two months from now. Or well, my now.<br/>
    <br/>
    I know you might or might not have believed me, but I know I’m right. I met Taeyong in the break room the next day,
    and we pieced together the last few pieces. I’m sure he’s told you, but just in case he hasn’t here’s the story
    people don’t hear:<br/>
    <br/>
    Mark Lee is an eighteen year old (international age) bipolar, depressed and anxious music prodigy, the spearhead of
    SM’s new boy group’s music direction. His parents are the founders and board members of SuperM Inc., a company with
    a reputation for its scandal-less past despite twenty-six whole years since its founding. As you can probably tell,
    this wasn’t a walk in the park for Mark.<br/>
    <br/>
    He grew up with the mentality to survive as an independent, quick-witted child, learning to become the world’s next
    big businessman. He used to practice guitar in the bathroom in fear of his parents hearing him. He was a playground
    bully, but he was also the kid who would throw every kid in his grade and the grade below birthday parties. He was
    the bright child every teacher loved, but he was also the moody and angry teenager that made enemies when he
    couldn’t handle the pressure at home. He made a lot of enemies. But also a lot of friends.<br/>
    <br/>
    The last string snapped when Na Jaemin, mind clouded with jealousy and fear of losing his best friend, ditched his
    sweetheart image and started a rumour. A rumour about Lee Donghyuck, but it was so instantly recognizable as
    something Mark might’ve said, from how it spread in the music production majors to the source: senior girls Mark did
    projects with. At the same time, Huang Renjun had discovered Mark’s suicidal tendencies and Lee Jeno’s financial
    reliance on Mark. Unlike Donghyuck, who turned on Mark, Renjun decided to help Mark. The scale seemed to balance.
    Mark lost two acquaintances, but gained one life-long one.<br/>
    <br/>
    Until his parents noticed his lack of income despite working for one of the biggest companies in South Korea. He had
    at most two weeks until they’d find out, and entirely too much money left to transfer. So he stole. He bought a
    speaker and stuffed the rest into the case, along with a note. He also wrote Jeno a note to bid him farewell, as
    well as asking for him to look out for Renjun.  He talked with Jaemin one last time, asking him to take care of
    Donghyuck for him, because Mark wasn’t the nicest to him. Jaemin, on his way in, threw his gum onto a desk and
    knocked over a milk carton by accident. It got into the school’s antique electrical system, shutting off cameras for
    an hour. Mark arrived next, and Jaemin left the room afterwards, deciding to make up with Mark, not even noticing
    what he’d accidentally done. After that, Mark took out a kitchen knife he stole that morning, seeing as it was
    missing from the Lees residence, and…<br/>
    <br/>
    Well. You can tell what happened next.<br/>
    <br/>
    So here’s my question, detective. Did you guess right? Did you send Lee Jeno, the innocent bystander to jail? Did
    you think it was Huang Renjun, the best friend who seemed to know too much? Did you accuse Na Jaemin, whose entire
    life had been dictated by jealousy and longing? Did you take Lee Donghyuck, the bitter and hot-headed rival to court
    instead? Or did you send me?<br/>
    <br/>
    I guess I’ll find out soon. You can’t punish the real culprits anyways. It’s just how the world works. Someone
    innocent had to go. There really isn't a right answer in life anyway. I hope you'll get a better case next time.<br/>
    <br/>
    Sincerely,
    You-know-who
    <br/>
