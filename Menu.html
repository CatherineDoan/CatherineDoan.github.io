    Dear detective,<br/>
    <br/>
    On Monday morning, May 25th, 2020, a student by the name of Mark Lee was found dead in his homeroom class at Dream
    Academy of Performing Arts. Lee is found face down, lying over a desk in the middle of the classroom, a knife in
    his chest and through to his back. Light autopsy of the body shows that he died between 6 to 7 AM and an interview
    with his parents informed us he had come to school early that morning to practice for his upcoming showcase in his
    last year of high school. CCTVs in the school were revealed to have been tampered with, as a loop has been played
    from 5:49 AM to 7:04 AM that morning. As for the rest of the school, only five other students and the janitor are
    found, with the janitor being seen raking the front lawn by the neighbourhood around the school. As a result, the
    other five students have been named our suspects.<br/>
    <br/>
    You now have five days to interrogate the suspects with three meetings per day. If you ever need to review some
    evidence, please talk to Lee Taeyong, our lab scientist. He will notify us when new evidence arrives. We will be
    recording and listening into your meetings with the suspects in case anything happens, as well as watching through a
    camera. Good luck, detective.<br/>
    <br/>
